## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Video Input:** Accepts a live feed or recorded traffic video.
2. **Object Detection:** Identifies vehicles using a pre-trained YOLO / MobileNet model.
3. **Tracking:** Tracks vehicle movements using centroid or optical flow tracking.
4. **Counting & Flow Estimation:** Counts vehicles and estimates flow rates per frame.
5. **Visualization:** Displays processed frames and statistical insights.
